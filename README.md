## How To Use
Using the programme is extremely easy the user clicks on the item the customer is buying and it adds it to the table stating the "price","quantity", and "name" of the product
and while the user is adding items to the table it calculates the total amount owed. If the user pays with cash then the calculator type
GUI on the left is used to add up the total cash payed with. If the user wishes to remove a item then all they have to do is click on the selected item on the table
and click remove and this will remove the item off the list and the customer will not be charged for that. If the user wishes to clear the table then they must click the reset
button this will clear the everything. If the user wishes to print the reciept all they have to do is click the print button and it will save the receipt as a pdf and then 
they are able to print it. If the user wishes to exit the program then they must click on the exit button and it will display a prompt asking them if they are sure they
want to exit the program and if the user clicks yes then they will exit the program but if the user clicks no then the user will stay in the program.
